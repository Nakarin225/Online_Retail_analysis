## Cohort Analysis (Retention over User & Product Lifetime)
Cohort analysis is a technique used in data analysis to understand the behavior and characteristics of a specific group of individuals or entities over time. It involves grouping individuals who share a common characteristic or experience during a specific period, and then analyzing their behavior and outcomes.

In cohort analysis, the group of interest, called a cohort, is typically defined based on a shared attribute or event. For example, a cohort could consist of customers who made their first purchase in a particular month or users who signed up for a service in a specific year. The key idea is to track and compare the behavior and performance of cohorts over time to gain insights into customer or user trends and patterns.

Here are some common steps involved in performing cohort analysis:

Define the cohort: Determine the criteria for creating cohorts based on the specific attribute or event of interest.

Collect data: Gather relevant data about the cohorts, such as their behavior, actions, or outcomes, over a specified time period.

Analyze cohort performance: Compare and analyze the behavior, metrics, or key performance indicators (KPIs) of each cohort over time. This can include metrics like customer retention, revenue, conversion rates, or engagement levels.

Visualize results: Present the cohort analysis results using visualizations such as cohort charts, line graphs, or heatmaps. These visual representations help identify trends and patterns across different cohorts.

Draw insights and make decisions: Based on the analysis, identify trends, patterns, or differences in behavior among cohorts. Use these insights to inform business strategies, such as optimizing marketing campaigns, improving customer retention, or identifying areas for product improvement.

Cohort analysis can provide valuable insights into customer behavior, customer lifecycle, user retention, and the effectiveness of marketing campaigns over time. It helps businesses understand how different groups of customers or users evolve and perform, enabling more targeted and data-driven decision-making.

RFM customer segmentation is a method used by businesses to categorize their customers based on their purchasing behavior and tenure with the company. It stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value with each component representing a different aspect of customer behavior. Let's break down each element:

1. Recency: Recency refers to the time since a customer's last purchase or interaction with the company. It helps determine how recently a customer has engaged with the business. Generally, customers who have made a purchase more recently are considered more valuable because they are more likely to make additional purchases in the future.

2. Frequency: Frequency measures how often a customer engages with the company over a specific period. It indicates the number of transactions or interactions a customer has had within a given timeframe. Customers who frequently interact or purchase from the company are often considered more loyal and valuable.

3. Monetary Value: Monetary Value represents the amount of money a customer has spent on purchases with the company. It takes into account the total value of all transactions made by a customer, helping businesses identify their highest-spending customers. Customers with a higher monetary value are often targeted for upselling or special promotions.
